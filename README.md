# DoctoralStudies
<p>This is a working repository of the programs written to support my Doctoral Studies. The programs will be written in different languages - from C# to Python to F# to C/C++</p>
<p>Introduction to Compututational Science - this is a collection of Windows forms and class objects to run common models that use different types of methods based on differential and derivative equations. In addition there is a method to determine a numerical value's percision, magnitude, that can also be used to calculate the absolute and relative errors. An API interface is currently under development to allow the consumption of the models via web protocols. The projects are IntoTCompScience and has dependency on ComputerScienceMethods. The ComputerScienceMethods is a library and can be built and consumed independently.</p>
